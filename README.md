# RNN-FamilyName-RegionPredictor
An RNN-based model designed to predict a person's region of origin based on their family name. This project leverages sequence modeling techniques in PyTorch to uncover cultural and regional patterns embedded in names.

## Commercial Applications
- **Personalized Marketing:** Deliver tailored campaigns by inferring regional preferences.

- **Recruitment Insights:** Promote diversity by understanding name-based demographics.

- **Genealogy Services:** Assist users in exploring their ancestral origins.

- **Fraud Detection:** Identify mismatches between names and claimed regions.

- **Tourism Personalization:** Curate travel experiences using region-specific insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate attention mechanisms for better name segmentation.

- Expand dataset for broader regional coverage.

- Develop a web interface for real-time predictions.
